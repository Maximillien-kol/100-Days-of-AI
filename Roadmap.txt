100-Day AI Engineer Master Plan
Goal: Become job-ready AI Engineer in 100 days.


Style: 2 hours per day (you can do more if you like).
Output: Share daily progress on YouTube (project, code, summary).
Outcome: By Day 100, you’ll have skills in Python, ML, DL, NLP, and a portfolio with at least 3+ real-world projects.


Tools to Use for Free
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
Kaggle (for datasets and notebooks)
Hugging Face (free NLP tools)
Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Streamlit, Gradio (for deployment)
GitHub (portfolio)
